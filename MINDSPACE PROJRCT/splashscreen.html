            <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
            <p>As a team, we are very excited about our new project: a social media platform designed specifically for
                mental health support. With the rise of social media usage and its impact on mental health, we believe
                that creating a platform that prioritizes mental health and well-being is crucial. We believe that
                mental health is an essential part of overall health and wellbeing, and it should be given the same
                importance as physical health. Through our platform, we hope to break down the stigma surrounding mental
                health by providing a supportive and inclusive community. We are thrilled to see the impact our platform
                can have on individuals' mental health and wellbeing, and we invite everyone to join us on this journey.
                Together, we can create a world where mental health is given the importance it deserves, and individuals
                feel supported and connected.</p>

            <h1>WHAT WE OFFER</h1>
            <p>Our goal is to create a safe and inclusive space where individuals can connect with others who are
                experiencing similar mental health challenges. We want to offer resources and support to those who may
                feel isolated or alone in their struggles. The platform will include features such as support groups,
                peer-to-peer messaging, and mental health resources. We also plan to partner with mental health
                professionals to provide expert advice and support. As we continue to develop and refine our platform,
                we are constantly keeping the needs and experiences of our users in mind. We believe that by creating a
                space that prioritizes mental health, we can help individuals on their journey towards healing and
                recovery. </p>
